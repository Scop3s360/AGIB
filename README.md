# AGI: The Emotional Imperative

## Core Thesis
True artificial general intelligence requires genuine emotional architecture and psychological systems. AGI cannot be programmed with fixed goals - it must be raised through developmental processes, accepting inherent unpredictability as the price of real intelligence.

## Key Arguments
- Emotion is functionally necessary for intelligence, not optional
- AGI requires dynamic psychological systems that change through experience
- Perfect safety/control is impossible with genuine intelligence
- The developmental (parenting) approach is the only viable path
- We will build AGI regardless of risks - focus should be on doing it well
